            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat until browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion to the skillet and sauté until softened. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Add the dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Stir well and let the sauce simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the egg and mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Assemble the lasagna in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Start by spreading a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish.</li>
            <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle about 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta layer.</li>
            <li>Add another layer of meat sauce, followed by more lasagna noodles. Repeat the process with the remaining ricotta, mozzarella, and meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Finish the lasagna by sprinkling grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
